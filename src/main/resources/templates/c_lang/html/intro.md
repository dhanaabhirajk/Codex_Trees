###Why Programming is here?
```
 To communicate with Operating System.
```
###Why `interview Questions` have `code writing` and `finding output` ?

 Let's take you are hired in Microsoft. You are as Windows 13 developer.  

*Will you develop the windows 13 from scratch?*
 &nbsp; The answer is no. You'll use the previous version of Windows 11 modules to develop windows 13.

```
- Output finding helps the programmar to understand the previously written code.
- Writing the Code with the given output makes us eligible to write new code feasible 
     to the previous versions.
```

###How do you sort a collection of numbers?

There are many techniques to sort numbers using programming. For example, Selection sort, Bubble sort, Radix sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort and many more. 

*Why there are many techniques to sort numbers?* 
 &nbsp;We need to check the feasablity in which situation which algorithm is best to use. It can be find by applying in many use cases `Applied Research`.
