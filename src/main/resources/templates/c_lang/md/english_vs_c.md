#Difference between English and C language
---
###English vs C

| English      | C Programming | 
| :----        |    :----   |
| Alphabets <br> - *a,b,c,...z*      | keywords <br> *int, float, char*     |
| Words <br>- *more than 10K*        | Operators <br>  *+  - *  / %*        |
| Sentences <br> - Grammar (set of rules)  :red_circle: ðŸŸ¡ ðŸŸ¢ | Separators <br> *; { }* |

- `Keywords` are like alphabets in english language. keywords are `reserved words` meant for specific purpose.
- `Operators` are used to perform `computation`. They are like words in English. This is used to construct the words.
- `Separator` are used to break into lines like `full stops` in english.

###Constants 
```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A(Constants)-->B(Integer Constants);
      A-->C(Real Constants);
      A-->D(Character Constants);
      B-->E[5<br>-5<br>0<br>8<br>1000];
      C-->F[2.75<br>-7.12<br>9.17<br>0.0];
      D-->G['a'<br>'4'<br>'A'<br>'+'<br>'z'];
      
```
They are classified into `Integer` , `real`, `Character` constants.
- `Integers constants` are numbers like count of chocalates but it can be in both `positive` and `negative`
- `Real constants` are numbers with floating points. Floating means the number is `not fixed and floats` so it is called floating point.
- `Character constants` are `single characters` within single quotes 

Examples of invalid character constants: 'Hi' ,'9.0','Ritche'
